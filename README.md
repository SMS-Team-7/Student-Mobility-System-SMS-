# Student Mobility System (SMS)

A decentralized student service and mobility platform powered by Hedera Hashgraph.

## Overview

Student Mobility System (SMS) is a decentralized web platform that connects students to essential campus services such as ride-sharing, book exchange, and task engagement.
It rewards users for participation through a transparent, token-based system built on the Hedera Token Service (HTS).

SMS creates a self-sustaining digital ecosystem where every student interaction generates real value.

## The Problem

Students face common challenges such as:

* Unreliable and expensive campus transportation
* Limited access to academic resources
* Low motivation to participate in campus activities
* Centralized platforms that charge high fees but provide no rewards

These issues lead to disengagement and lost economic opportunities within the student community.

## Our Solution

SMS transforms everyday actions into valuable experiences.

Users can:

* Book or offer rides
* Buy or sell textbooks
* Complete engagement or community tasks

Each action earns tokens automatically through Hedera’s token infrastructure.
These tokens can be saved, spent, or redeemed for in-app benefits, forming a continuous value cycle.

## How It Works

1. Users register as students, drivers, or vendors.
2. Each meaningful action is recorded and verified.
3. Tokens are automatically transferred from the treasury to the user’s wallet via the Hedera network.
4. Users can view, copy, and use their wallet addresses securely through the connected account system.
5. As more users engage, the ecosystem grows stronger and more valuable.

## Why It Matters

* Builds a self-sustaining student economy
* Rewards users for participation
* Uses Hedera’s fast, low-cost, and transparent blockchain network
* Encourages collaboration between students, drivers, and vendors
* Promotes financial inclusion in campus environments

## Vision

To make every student interaction—academic, social, or commercial—valuable.
SMS aims to create decentralized student economies where participation equals opportunity.
